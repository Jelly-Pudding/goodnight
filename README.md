# Goodnight Plugin
**Goodnight Plugin** is a simple Minecraft Paper 1.21.1 plugin that allows players to vote skip the night by typing /goodnight. When a configurable percentage of players have said goodnight, the night will be skipped.

2. Place the `.jar` file in your Minecraft serverâ€™s `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server.

## Configuration
In `config.yml`, set the percentage of players required to skip the night (default is 33%):

```yaml
sleep-percentage: 33.0
```

## Commands
- `/goodnight [custom message]`: Announces that a player is ready to skip the night. A custom message can be optionally added.
